            <h2>Entanglement and the power of one qubit</h2>
            <p>The “power of one qubit” refers to a computational model that has access to only one pure bit of quantum information, along with 
n
 qubits in the totally mixed state. This model, though not as powerful as a pure-state quantum computer, is capable of performing some computational tasks exponentially faster than any known classical algorithm. One such task is to estimate with fixed accuracy the normalized trace of a unitary operator that can be implemented efficiently in a quantum circuit. We show that circuits of this type generally lead to entangled states, and we investigate the amount of entanglement possible in such circuits, as measured by the multiplicative negativity. We show that the multiplicative negativity is bounded by a constant, independent of 
n
, for all bipartite divisions of the 
n
+
1
 qubits, and so becomes, when 
n
 is large, a vanishingly small fraction of the maximum possible multiplicative negativity for roughly equal divisions. This suggests that the global nature of entanglement is a more important resource for quantum computation than the magnitude of the entanglement.</p>

            <h2>Theory of electromagnetic waves</h2>
            <p>Macroscopic Maxwell's theory is considered along with plane waves in homogeneous media, reflection and transmission, guidance and resonance, and electromagnetic theory and special relativity. Aspects of radiation and scattering are investigated, taking into account dipole antennas and stratified media. A description is presented of theorems of waves and media, giving attention to the equivalence principle, reaction and reciprocity, the quantization of electromagnetic waves, four-dimensional notation, and the Lagrangian formulation of macroscopic electromagnetic theory.</p>
